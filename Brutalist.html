		The term brutalism is derived from the French béton brut, meaning “raw concrete”.
		Although most brutalist buildings are made from concrete, we're more interested in the term raw.
		Concrete brutalist buildings often reflect back the forms used to make them, and their overall
		design tends to adhere to the concept of truth to materials.
A website's materials aren't HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code. Rather, they are its content and
the context in which it's consumed. A website is for a visitor, using a browser, running on a
computer to read, watch, listen, or perhaps to interact. A website that embraces Brutalist Web Design
 is raw in its focus on content, and prioritization of the website visitor.
Brutalist Web Design is honest about what a website is and what it isn't.
A website is not a magazine, though it might have magazine-like articles. A website is not an application,
although you might use it to purchase products or interact with other people. A website is not a database,
although it might be driven by one.
A website is about giving visitors content to enjoy and ways to interact with you.
The design guidelines outlined above—and detailed below—all are in the service of making websites
more of what they are and less of what they aren't.
These aren't restrictive rules to produce boring, minimalist websites. Rather these are a set of priorities that put the
visitor to your site—the entire reason your website exists—front and center in all things.
